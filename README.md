## My experience

The challenge for me is to come algorithm first using the standard library only. The intention is to learn and feel the
language in itself. I mean, there is a reason for the language to have exactly what is has in SDK.

Having all that in mind, my concern is to create the properly maintainable code, which is nice to read, understand and
hopefully learn from it.
